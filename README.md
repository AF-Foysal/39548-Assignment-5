**API Documentation:** [PokeAPI Documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

**Description:**
PokeAPI is a comprehensive Pokémon database API that provides information about Pokémon species, abilities, and more.


**Usage on Site:**
- The "Pokemon" component utilizes this API to fetch and display Pokémon details based on user input.
- Encountered a type error in the Pokemon function while fetching data from the Pokemon API. The type error in the Pokemon function was related to the fact that the API request was being made with an empty or undefined pokemonName. To address this, implemented a conditional check (an if statement) to ensure that the API request is only made when a valid pokemonName is provided. (also doubles as instructions)
